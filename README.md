# update_date_in_cv
This project will aim to automate date update in a cv.

## Description
The code will go to the cv, find the date at the bottom of the cv, update it according to the up-to-date date and update it.

## Benefit
This will automate the process of updating the date in the cv when applying to jobs on a new day.

## TBD
1) Get current days date. Convert it in the German format: e.g. 12. November 2023. Put it like that as date.
2) Export the saved output .odt file to .pdf format

## Lessons Learned
Content of ODT file is stored as XML format. One can interact with the corresponding XML file to make changes in the ODT file.
